# The Shack

## Front End Developer Assessment Project

Assessment Objective

This assessment project is designed to help Group have a better understanding of your layout, design, and technical skills. The deliverable will be a fully functional, built from scratch, landing page delivered in the format of your choice. Please ensure we can view your project in its entirety from either our local machines or through a URL you provide.

You will be evaluated on:

1. Your approach to the layout and design

2. Your ability to produce quality code

3. The creativity you express through your design and code

4. Your approach to desktop and mobile layouts

5. Modern browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE 10+, Android, iOS)

Deadline & Delivery: Please email me at jmack@group.com your final project or URL link by Friday, July 21 at 5pm MST. Please do not use an existing template such as a WordPress template to create your project. We want to see something you built from scratch. However, feel free to use JavaScript plugins and frameworks.

Project Scenario:

You are developing a new landing page for The Shack (a Christian based book that is like a product Group would sell). You can use any of the existing assets on the current website (http://theshackbook.com/) or anything else you find out on the web to create this page. The objectives of this landing page are to: 1. Make use of Twitter Bootstrap 3 in your project (http://getbootstrap.com/) but don't be afraid to get creative and expand upon it.

2. Sell the book in a creative way while still honoring the brand outside of a simple product description page

3. Introduce the user to some of the other The Shack products

4. Have some form of a non-functional lead capture mechanism that users can give their information for something in return

5. Make use of exceptional UI to organize and present the information

a. Things like accordions, sliders, tabs, toggles, on-page navigation, visual breaks, demand based information, etc... are just a few examples of what you might use.

6. Wow us with the creativity you express through your work

a. Make use of some <svg> elements

b. Introduce some simple animation

7. If you feel the need, fabricate your own content even if it's placeholder text

Overall Business Objectives:

1. Increase online purchases of The Shack book and its other companion products

2. Although this is a book, make this product feel premium in nature through the overall approach to the landing page

Landing Pages we LOVE: · https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/

a. Exceptional information architecture, lots of eye candy that supports the product · http://www.firewatchgame.com/

a. Simple use of parallax animation at top of page that enhances the experience · https://www.heroku.com/

a. Simple, visually pleasing, some minor use of animation to enhance understanding

The Legal Stuff:

The Shack is NOT a Group Publishing resource. There should be no reference to Group. Do not use Group's online style guide, website navigation or page templates in your design concept.
